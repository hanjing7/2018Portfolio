Difference between the three views:
width more than 1024px:
normal display with black background

Tablet view (width between 768 and 1024)
background become white

Mobile view (width smaller than 768)
background become red
instead of showing the slideshow, display button including 
links to targeted site since slideshow and js loading is too heavy for mobile device.

Implementation of media query
Implemented inside the core html document to make sure they are loaded after the rest of css settings and could override previous settings. 
Furthermore, make sure the setting configuration for smaller screen is behind settings for larger screen so the page is responsive as the screen size changes
